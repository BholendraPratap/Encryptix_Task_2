Customer Churn Prediction

Overview

Customer churn prediction is a critical task in customer retention strategies. This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts whether a customer will churn based on historical data. By identifying potential churners, businesses can take proactive measures to retain customers.

Dataset

The dataset contains customer-related information, including demographic details, financial status, and activity behavior. The features include:

CreditScore: Customer's credit score

Geography: Customer's location (encoded as categorical values)

Gender: Gender of the customer (encoded as 1 or 2)

Age: Age of the customer

Tenure: Number of years the customer has been with the company

Balance: Customer's account balance

NumOfProducts: Number of products held by the customer

HasCrCard: Whether the customer has a credit card (1 = Yes, 0 = No)

IsActiveMember: Whether the customer is an active member (1 = Yes, 0 = No)

EstimatedSalary: Estimated salary of the customer

Exited: Target variable (1 = Churned, 0 = Retained)

Project Workflow

Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values

Encode categorical features

Normalize numerical features

Split data into training and testing sets

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualize churn distribution

Identify feature correlations

Detect outliers and anomalies

Model Training:

Train multiple machine learning models:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM, etc.)

Tune hyperparameters for optimal performance

Model Evaluation:

Use performance metrics:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-score

ROC-AUC Curve

Deployment:

Save the best-performing model

Develop a web application using Streamlit

Deploy on a cloud platform or host locally

Results

The best-performing model achieved an decend performance metrics.

Feature importance analysis indicated that age, credit score, and number of products are the most significant predictors of churn.

Future Improvements

Improve feature engineering to capture additional patterns.

Experiment with deep learning models (ANNs, LSTMs).

Implement real-time monitoring of customer churn trends.
